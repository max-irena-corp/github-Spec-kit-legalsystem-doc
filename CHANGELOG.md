## [0.1.19] - 2024-03-02

### Changed

- **Version Sync**: Aligned version with production repository (`jonas-spec-kit`)
  - Synchronized version numbering between `jonas-spec-kit-dev` and `jonas-spec-kit` repositories
  - Both repositories now use v0.1.19 as the current version

### Fixed

- Version consistency between development and production repositories

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **User Input Support in Context Command**: Enhanced `/speckit.context` workflow to accept optional user directives for guided analysis
  - Added `$ARGUMENTS` parameter support (matching `/speckit.constitution` pattern)
  - User can specify focus areas, terminology preferences, and architectural priorities
  - Remains fully optional - performs automated reverse-engineering when no input provided
  - **User Input Integration**:
    - Emphasizes user-mentioned components, patterns, or concerns throughout analysis
    - Uses domain-specific terms provided by user
    - Highlights integration points, data flows, or design decisions specified by user
    - Includes user-mentioned components prominently in generated Mermaid diagrams
    - Provides additional detail in sections relevant to user directives
  - **Benefits**:
    - Enables targeted documentation for specific architectural concerns
    - Maintains established business terminology and domain language
    - Focuses analysis on areas most relevant to current development needs
    - Improves documentation quality through human-AI collaboration

- **Intelligent Merge for Existing project-context.md Files**: Transformed context generation from "regenerate" to "update and refine"
  - **Pre-Analysis Phase (Section 2.0)**: Added preservation logic that executes before overwriting existing files
    - Reads existing `project-context.md` before creating backup
    - Extracts content for intelligent merging:
      - **Section 17 (Open Questions)**: Preserves existing questions, merges with newly discovered ones
      - **Section 18 (Guardrails & Non-Goals)**: Preserves unless contradicted by current code
      - **Section 20 (Changelog)**: Extracts all previous entries (never replaces, always appends)
      - **Terminology & Domain Language**: Notes established terms, acronyms, naming conventions
      - **Manual Clarifications**: Identifies hand-written notes, business context, editorial additions
    - Uses preserved content as analysis context to maintain consistency
    - Compares previous architectural descriptions to current source code to identify evolution
  - **Conflict Resolution Rules**:
    - **Code wins**: Fresh source code analysis overrides outdated architectural descriptions
    - **Manual wins**: Hand-written business context preserved unless directly contradicted by code
    - **Intelligent merge**: Combines lists, removes resolved questions, marks deprecated dependencies
    - **Document evolution**: Adds changelog entry noting significant changes between versions
  - **Writing Phase Updates**:
    - Phase 5 explicitly applies merge logic to sections 17, 18, and 20
    - Changelog template updated to note preservation requirement with example
    - Pre-write phase references completed pre-analysis
  - **Benefits**:
    - Preserves institutional knowledge and manual refinements across regenerations
    - Maintains business context that cannot be inferred from code alone
    - Documents architectural evolution over time in changelog
    - Prevents loss of carefully crafted guardrails and open questions
    - Makes documentation a living artifact that improves with each update

## [0.1.17] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Multi-Repository Workspace Auto-Switching for Planning Commands**: Standardized repository location validation across all planning commands
  - **All Planning Commands** (`constitution.md`, `specify.md`, `clarify.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `analyze.md`):
    - Added "Step 0: Repository Location Validation (Multi-Repo Workspaces)" section
    - Commands now automatically detect multi-repo vs single-repo workspaces
    - **Automatic switching**: When run from an implementation repository, commands automatically switch to the `*-document` repository before execution
    - Reports switching action: `📂 Switched to planning repository: <repo-name>-document`
    - Provides clear error if `*-document` repository not found in multi-repo workspace
    - Single-repo workspaces skip validation entirely (no performance impact)
  - **Benefits**:
    - Users can run planning commands from any repository in the workspace
    - Ensures planning artifacts are always created in the correct location
    - Fail-fast behavior with clear error messages
    - Transparent and automatic - no manual navigation required
  - **Exception**: `/speckit.context` intentionally runs from implementation repos and skips `*-document` repositories

### Changed

- **README.md Workflow Reordering**: Updated "Get Started" section to reflect recommended workflow sequence
  - **Step 2**: Gather implementation context (`/speckit.context`) - moved from step 3
  - **Step 3**: Establish project principles (`/speckit.constitution`) - moved from step 2
  - Rationale: Context gathering should occur before establishing principles to inform principle creation
  - Updated "Detailed Process" section to match the new ordering

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **PowerShell Parameter Binding Issue in Feature Creation Script**: Resolved PowerShell parameter binding error when using `-Json` switch with positional arguments
  - **Issue**: Command `create-new-feature.ps1 -Json -CustomPrefix "OCR-338" -ShortName "analysis-stuck-actions" "Improve UX for stuck analysis"` failed with error: `Cannot convert value "Improve UX for stuck analysis" to type "System.Boolean"`
  - **Root Cause**: PowerShell's parameter binding algorithm incorrectly attempted to bind the positional feature description string to the `-Json` switch parameter
  - **PowerShell Script (`create-new-feature.ps1`)**:
    - Added explicit `-Description` parameter as the first parameter to prevent binding confusion
    - Maintained backward compatibility with `ValueFromRemainingArguments` for positional usage
    - Combines both parameter values if somehow both are provided
    - Updated help documentation with recommended and legacy usage patterns
  - **Bash Script (`create-new-feature.sh`)**:
    - Added matching `--description` parameter for consistency with PowerShell version
    - Ensures identical interface across both platforms
    - Maintains backward compatibility with positional arguments
    - Updated help documentation to match PowerShell examples
  - **Specify Workflow (`specify.md`)**:
    - Updated script invocations to use explicit description parameter: `-Description "{ARGS}"` (PowerShell) and `--description "{ARGS}"` (Bash)
    - Updated all example commands throughout the document to use recommended explicit parameter syntax
  - **Benefits**:
    - Prevents parameter binding confusion when using switches with positional arguments
    - Provides consistent, self-documenting interface across both scripts
    - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
    - Improves robustness and clarity of script invocations

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-01

### Enhanced

- **Jira Development Task Discovery Enhancement**: Expanded development task retrieval to check both subtasks and linked issues when importing from Jira user stories
  - **Specify Workflow (`specify.md`)**:
    - Now retrieves development tasks from both `subtasks` and `issuelinks` fields when fetching Jira user stories
    - Added processing for linked issues with relevant link types: "implements", "is implemented by", "relates to", "depends on", "rolls up into", "breaks down into"
    - Filters linked issues by issue type (Development Task, Dev Task, Task, Technical Task) and keywords
    - Excludes non-development link types (duplicates, blocks) unless they are development tasks
    - Combines and deduplicates subtasks and linked issues into unified development task list
    - Updated presentation table to include "Source" column indicating whether task is a subtask or linked issue
    - Stores both `JIRA_SUBTASKS` and `JIRA_LINKED_ISSUES` variables for branch naming workflow
  - **Benefits**:
    - Provides more comprehensive view of development tasks associated with user stories
    - Supports different Jira workflows where development tasks may be represented as linked issues instead of subtasks
    - Improves flexibility for teams using various Jira issue linking strategies
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing subtask-only workflows

- **Context Command Backup Deletion Optimization**: Improved clarity and reliability of backup file cleanup in reverse-engineering workflow
  - **Context Workflow (`context.md`)**:
    - Made Post-Write Phase backup deletion instructions more explicit and actionable
    - Bolded deletion command to emphasize required action
    - Added explicit file pattern reference (`project-context.md.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`)
    - Added directive "(use file deletion operation)" to signal concrete action required
    - Added confirmation step to verify deletion succeeded
    - Made restoration steps more explicit with detailed copy operation instructions
  - **Benefits**:
    - Prevents agents from skipping or misinterpreting backup cleanup step
    - Reduces user intervention required during project-context.md generation
    - Improves workflow reliability and user experience
    - Ensures cleanup happens automatically after successful verification

## [0.1.14] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Jira Development Task Auto-Discovery in Specify Workflow**: Enhanced feature branch creation with automatic retrieval of development tasks from imported user stories
  - **Specify Workflow (`specify.md`)**:
    - Added automatic retrieval of subtasks from imported Jira user stories
    - Filters subtasks to identify development tasks by type and keywords
    - Presents available development tasks in formatted table with options to:
      - Select an existing development task (1, 2, 3, etc.)
      - Enter a different task manually (M)
      - Skip and use auto-numbering (N)
    - Auto-discovery only executes when user imports from Jira in Step 0
    - Falls back to manual input if no development tasks found or MCP server fails
    - Stores Jira context variables (`JIRA_STORY_IMPORTED`, `JIRA_STORY_KEY`, `JIRA_CLOUD_ID`, `JIRA_SUBTASKS`) for later use
  - **Benefits**:
    - Eliminates manual task key entry when development tasks already exist in Jira
    - Provides better visibility into available development tasks associated with user story
    - Streamlines workflow for teams using Jira for task management
    - Maintains flexibility with manual entry and auto-numbering fallback options
